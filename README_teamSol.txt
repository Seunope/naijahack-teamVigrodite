Problem
Lack of solution and access to past questions and answers to prepare students for their upcoming exams has been a major challenge that most students face.

Proposed solution
Sol.tech is an educational website that solves this major challenge by granting access to students offering a particular course from any institution to upload past questions and solved answers so that other students who are taking that course can answer t. It also allows student to take CBT tests for a certain time limit so as to be time conscious while answering questions. The platform can be used by schools, universities, colleges who want to prepare students or exams.


Proposed Stack
Laravel,php,html,css,javascript,jquery,mysql, wolfram,linode
